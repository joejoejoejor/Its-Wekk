We will mostly be calling columns *features* and rows *observations*, but you should be aware that there are other terminologies used in the literature, some of which are more common in certain fields.\n",

But these are more advanced topics that we will not cover here. However, they might come up in your projects, so you can always come back to this notebook for reference.\n",
